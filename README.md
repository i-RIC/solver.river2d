# Overview
River2D is an unsteady two-dimensional depth averaged finite element hydrodynamic model written by Professor Peter Steffler of the University of Alberta. This model is very good for certain kinds of complex domains that cannot be well treated with finite difference models. River2d has been customized for fish habitat evaluation studies and used extensively for that purpose all around the world. The following URL provides additional information about River2d: http://www.river2d.ualberta.ca/ .

# CONSOLE APPLICATION : River2D Project Overview
AppWizard has created this River2D application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your River2D application.

## River2D.vcxproj
This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the Application Wizard.
    
## River2D.vcxproj.filters
This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. It contains information about the association between the files in your project and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the Source Files" filter).

## River2D.cpp
This is the main application source file.

---

# Other standard files:

## StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named River2D.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

# Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
